        <h2 id="Bio">Biography</h2>

        <p>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal developer of the
            Linux
            kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control system
            Git.
            Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the University
            of
            Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has
            become one of the most widely used kernels in the world, powering everything from smartphones to
            supercomputers.
